In addition to applying for initial access, all solutions using the Azure OpenAI service are required to go through a use case review before they can be released for production use.\\n\\nMore specific information is included in the application form. We appreciate your patience as we work to responsibly enable broader access to the Azure OpenAI service.\\n\\nApply here for initial access or for a production review:\\n\\n<a href=\"https://aka.ms/oaiapply\" target=\"_blank\">Apply now</a>\\n\\nAll solutions using the Azure OpenAI service are also required to go through a use case review before they can be released for production use, and are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. In general, the more sensitive the scenario the more important risk mitigation measures will be for approval.\\n\\n## Comparing Azure OpenAI and OpenAI\\n\\nAzure OpenAI Service gives customers advanced language AI with OpenAI GPT-3, Codex, and DALL-E models with the security and enterprise promise of Azure. Azure OpenAI co-develops the APIs with OpenAI, ensuring compatibility and a smooth transition from one to the other.\\n\\nWith Azure OpenAI, customers get the security capabilities of Microsoft Azure while running the same models as OpenAI. Azure OpenAI offers private networking, regional availability, and responsible AI content filtering.  \\n\\n## Key concepts\\n\\n### Prompts & Completions\\n\\nThe completions endpoint is the core component of the API service. This API provides access to the model\\'s text-in, text-out interface. Users simply need to provide an input  **prompt** containing the English text command, and the model will generate a text **completion**.\\n\\nHere\\'s an example of a simple prompt and completion:\\n\\n>**Prompt', metadata={'source': '../data/qna/overview_openai.txt'}), Document(page_content='**:\\n        ```\\n        \"\"\"\\n        count to 5 in a for loop\\n        \"\"\"\\n        ```\\n>\\n>**Completion**:\\n        ```\\n        for i in range(1, 6):\\n            print(i)\\n        ```\\n\\n### Tokens\\n\\nOpenAI Enterprise processes text by breaking it down into tokens. Tokens can be words or just chunks of characters. For example, the word “hamburger” gets broken up into the tokens “ham”, “bur” and “ger”, while a short and common word like “pear” is a single token. Many tokens start with a whitespace, for example “ hello” and “ bye”.\\n\\nThe total number of tokens processed in a given request depends on the length of your input, output and request parameters. The quantity of tokens being processed will also affect your response latency and throughput for the models.\\n\\n### Resources\\n\\nThe Azure OpenAI service is a new product offering on Azure. You can get started with the Azure OpenAI service the same way as any other Azure product where you [create a resource](how-to/create-resource.md), or instance of the service, in your Azure Subscription. You can read more about Azure\\'s [resource management design](../../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md).\\n\\n### Deployments\\n\\nOnce you create an Azure OpenAI Resource, you must deploy a model before you can start making API calls and generating text. This action can be done using the Deployment APIs. These APIs allow you to specify the model you wish to use.\\n\\n### In-context learning\\n\\nThe models used by the Azure OpenAI service use natural language instructions and examples provided during the generation call to identify the task being asked and skill required. When you use this approach, the first part of the prompt includes natural language instructions and/or examples of the specific task desired. The model then completes the task by predicting the most probable next piece of text. This technique is known as \"in-context\" learning. These models aren\\'t retrained during this step but instead give predictions based on the context you include in the prompt.\\n\\nThere are three main approaches for in-context learning: Few-shot, one-shot and zero-shot. These approaches vary based on the amount of task-specific data that is given to the model:\\n\\n**Few-shot**: In this case, a user includes several examples in the call prompt that demonstrate the expected answer format and content. The following example shows a few-shot prompt where we provide multiple examples (the model will generate the last answer):\\n\\n```\\n    Convert the questions to a command:\\n    Q: Ask Constance if we need some bread.\\n    A: send-msg `find constance` Do we need some bread?\\n    Q: Send a message to Greg to figure out if things are ready for Wednesday.\\n    A: send-msg `find greg` Is everything ready for Wednesday?\\n    Q: Ask Ilya if we\\'re still having our meeting this evening.\\n    A: send-msg `find ilya` Are we still having a meeting this evening?\\n    Q: Contact the ski store and figure out if I can get my skis fixed before I leave on Thursday.\\n    A: send-msg `find ski store` Would it be possible to get my skis fixed before I leave on Thursday?\\n    Q: Thank Nicolas for lunch.\\n    A: send-msg `find nicolas` Thank you for lunch!\\n    Q: Tell Constance that I won\\'t be home before 19:30 tonight — unmovable meeting.\\n    A: send-msg `find constance` I won\\'t be home before 19:30 tonight. I have a meeting I can\\'t move.\\n    Q: Tell John that I need to book an appointment at 10:30.\\n    A: \\n```\\n\\nThe number of examples typically range from 0 to 100 depending on how many can fit in the maximum input length for a single prompt. Maximum input length can vary depending on the specific models you use. Few-shot learning enables a major reduction in the amount of task-specific data required for accurate predictions. This', metadata={'source': '../data/qna/overview_openai.txt'}), Document(page_content=' approach will typically perform less accurately than a fine-tuned model.\\n\\n**One-shot**: This case is the same as the few-shot approach except only one example is provided. \\n\\n**Zero-shot**: In this case, no examples are provided to the model and only the task request is provided.\\n\\n### Models\\n\\nThe service provides users access to several different models. Each model provides a different capability and price point. The GPT-3 base models are known as Davinci, Curie, Babbage, and Ada in decreasing order of capability and increasing order of speed.\\n\\nThe Codex series of models is a descendant of GPT-3 and has been trained on both natural language and code to power natural language to code use cases. Learn more about each model on our [models concept page](./concepts/models.md).\\n\\n## Next steps\\n\\nLearn more about the [underlying models that power Azure OpenAI](./concepts/models.md).\\n', metadata={'source': '../data/qna/overview_openai.txt'}), Document(page_content='\\n# What is conversational language understanding?\\n\\nConversational language understanding is one of the custom features offered by [Azure Cognitive Service for Language](../overview.md). It is a cloud-based API service that applies machine-learning intelligence to enable you to build natural language understanding component to be used in an end-to-end conversational application. \\n\\nConversational language understanding (CLU) enables users to build custom natural language understanding models to predict the overall intention of an incoming utterance and extract important information from it. CLU only provides the intelligence to understand the input text for the client application and doesn\\'t perform any actions. By creating a CLU project, developers can iteratively label utterances, train and evaluate model performance before making it available for consumption. The quality of the labeled data greatly impacts model performance. To simplify building and customizing your model, the service offers a custom web portal that can be accessed through the [Language studio](https://aka.ms/languageStudio). You can easily get started with the service by following the steps in this [quickstart](quickstart.md). \\n\\nThis documentation contains the following article types:\\n\\n* [Quickstarts](quickstart.md) are getting-started instructions to guide you through making requests to the service.\\n* [Concepts](concepts/evaluation-metrics.md) provide explanations of the service functionality and features.\\n* [How-to guides](how-to/create-project.md) contain instructions for using the service in more specific or customized ways.\\n\\n\\n## Example usage scenarios\\n\\nCLU can be used in multiple scenarios across a variety of industries. Some examples are:\\n\\n### End-to-end conversational bot\\n\\nUse CLU to build and train a custom natural language understanding model based on a specific domain and the expected users\\' utterances. Integrate it with any end-to-end conversational bot so that it can process and analyze incoming text in real time to identify the intention of the text and extract important information from it. Have the bot perform the desired action based on the intention and extracted information. An example would be a customized retail bot for online shopping or food ordering.\\n\\n### Human assistant bots\\n\\nOne example of a human assistant bot is to help staff improve customer engagements by triaging customer queries and assigning them to the appropriate support engineer. Another example would be a human resources bot in an enterprise that allows employees to communicate in natural language and receive guidance based on the query.\\n\\n### Command and control application\\n\\nWhen you integrate a client application with a speech-to-text component, users can speak a command in natural language for CLU to process, identify intent, and extract information from the text for the client application to perform an action. This use case has many applications, such as to stop, play, forward, and rewind a song or turn lights on or off.\\n\\n### Enterprise chat bot\\n\\nIn a large corporation, an enterprise chat bot may handle a variety of employee affairs. It might handle frequently asked questions served by a custom question answering knowledge base, a calendar specific skill served by conversational language understanding, and an interview feedback skill served by LUIS. Use Orchestration workflow to connect all these skills together and appropriately route the incoming requests to the correct service.\\n\\n\\n## Project development lifecycle\\n\\nCreating a CLU project typically involves several different steps. \\n\\n:::image type=\"content\" source=\"media/development-lifecycle.png\" alt-text=\"The development lifecycle\" lightbox=\"media/development-lifecycle.png\":::\\n\\nFollow these steps to get the most out of your model:\\n\\n1. **Define your schema**: Know your data and define the actions and relevant information that needs to be recognized from user\\'s input utterances.
